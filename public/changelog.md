# Update (05/29/2022): New tank!
- New tank: Demolitionist
  -Launches explosive bullets that expand and destroy all in their path

# Update (05/29/2022): New plans
- There are plans to actually put these custom tanks as branches of existing tanks
  - So I may hopefully not have to even fix the aforementioned bug

# Update (05/29/2022): bugs hurty my brain
- Screen flies away when more than 16 tanks are in the upgrade menu
  - There will be a page 2 tank until I can fix this
  
# Update (05/29/2022): DONUTS!!!! (mmmm yummy mmmmmmm)
- NEW DONUT SHAPE!
  - No tanks or shapes actually use it yet but its there!
  - I mean there is a donut basic if you want.
- Stars
  - A rare star shaped polygon worth 40,000 points!
  - More is planned with it like temporary invincibility when destroyed!

# Update (05/29/2022): misery
- Spent probably 30 minutes adding shape dip for more unique shapes
  - You may notice that some tanks already have these new shapes!
- Fixed bug that allowed any entity to go invisible
- Pressing T will break the game, a fix is on the way.

# Update (05/29/2022): new stuff
- New tank: Teaser
  - A swarmer type 
- Everyone are no longer beta testers
  - not that it matters since someone can steal any key they want
    - i probably shouldn't have said that
- Updated Upgrade UI look
  - It's now red, no longer displays [N/A] and can hold more tanks.
