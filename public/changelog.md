# Update (05/29/2022): DONUTS!!!!
- NEW DONUT SHAPE!
  - no tanks or shapes actually use it yet but its there!
- Stars
  - a rare star shaped polygon worth 40,000 points!
  - more is planned with it like temporary invincibility when destroyed!

# Update (05/29/2022): misery
- Spent probably 30 minutes adding shape dip for more unique shapes
  - You may notice that some tanks already have these new shapes!
- Fixed bug that allowed any entity to go invisible
- Pressing T will break the game, a fix is on the way.
